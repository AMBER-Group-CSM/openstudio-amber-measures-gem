# OpenStudio AMBER Group Measures
This is a collection of OpenStudio Measures created by the Advanced Multiscale Building Energy Research (AMBER) Group at Colorado School of Mines.

The Advanced Multiscale Building Energy Research (AMBER) Group studies and simulates energy interactions at different scales, from heat transfer happening inside the building envelope to energy interactions in a connected community. We combine laboratory, field and numerical work with an emphasis on making buildings and communities more energy efficient and grid friendly.

Group Director: Dr. Paulo Cesar Tabares-Velasco
